**Overview of the statistical analysis:**
-
The purpose of this analysis was to help Kate form a bikesharing business in Des Moines and decide if it will be successful in Des Moines. We had use Tableau to make graphs, heatmaps, and bar charts to look at the trends of the data from New York City to decide if a bikesharing business will be successful in Des Moines too.

**Results:**
-
***Checkout Times for Users:***

The graph above shows the trip duration in minutes for the month of August. Most trips taken are about 5 minutes, since the line shows 146,752 bikes that were used for 5 minutes.

***Checkout Times by Gender:***

The graph above shows the difference in minutes of trip duration between different genders. Each gender is a different line color.  The most common minute of trip duration males spent was 5 minutes, most common amount of minutes females spent was 6 minutes, while unknown usually spent 10 minutes. This graph also shows more males tend to use bikesharing compared to females since there were 108,087 male riders, while only 34,151 female riders.

***Trips by Weekday per Hour:***

The heatmap above shows the peak hours for each day and time of the week. The darker colors means that more bikes are being used at those times, which means that more bikes are being used during the 8am hour and the 5pm hour on weekdays. Since it shows more people need this on weekdays during those hours, that can mean they are using it to commute to and from work.

***Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour):***

The heatmap above is similar to the previous heatmap called "Trips by Weekday per Hour" since it also shows the weekdays and times its commonly used, but this one is different because it also shows the difference between gender. This shows that more male riders use this than females, but the most common times and days bikesharing is being used is still the same as the previous heatmap.

***User Trips by Gender by Weekday:***

The chart above shows the difference of bikesharing use between user type, their gender, and the days they use them. It also shows that subscribers tend to use these bikes more on weekdays compared to weekends for subscribers. However, for customers these bikes are used more on weekends than weekdays.

**Charts from module reading:**

***August Peak Hours:***

The bar chart above shows the hours the bikesharing is most used, but doesnâ€™t say what day. It shows that its being used most during the 8AM hour and the 5-6PM hours since the bar is longer on the graph.

***Top Starting Location:***

The map above shows the top starting locations where this bikesharing is most used. The bigger and darker colored circles mean there are more citibikes being used, while the lighter colored circles means there are less bike being used.

**Summary:**
-
Most trips are taken on Mondays-Fridays on the hours of 8AM and 5PM. This could show the types of people who are using this bikesharing service because they could be commuting to and from work with it. Another result I noticed is that males tend to use bikesharing more than women. For example, only 10,511 females use bikesharing on Thursdays at 5pm, while 30,561 males use this on Thursdays at 5pm. Most of these trips taken tend to be about 5-10 minutes so this could show that bike stations in New York City are close to each other. This could show that the bike stations in Des Moines should be close to each other too to make a bikesharing business successful.

One visualization I would suggest for future analysis would be making a visualization for the most common starting locations by user type because this could help the business know which type of person to focus on. Another visualization I would suggest would be a chart to show the difference in bikesharing use between customers and subscribers, how long each uses it for, and without considering their gender since that can help us know the overall visualization between the two user types and where to focus their business on.
